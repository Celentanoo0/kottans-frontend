## 0. Git Basics
I'm very excited about learning this course. I think I understand almost everything about git now. Thank you so much for giving such interesting information. I hope I'll be strong enough to finish the whole Stage 0 ;)

+ It was very useful information for me. I've already known basic Linux commands, but it's always good to repeat things you already know, isn't it?;)
+ Also, I didn't know anything neither about HTTP nor about HTTPS so I got a lot of new and very useful information for myself from this lesson.
